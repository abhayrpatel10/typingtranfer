## Inspiration
# Link: typingtransfer.netlify.app
In India, a lot of bank-related transaction didn't use to happen online and required a lot of paperwork but due to covid a lot of bank-related transactions were forced to move online, but this also came with the rising online banking frauds in India.

According to the RBI’s annual report, bank frauds of ₹100,000 and above have more than doubled in value to ₹1.85 lakh crores in FY20 as compared to ₹71,500 crores in FY19. Also, the number of such cases has increased by 28% in the same period. 

Having personally seen friends and family fall for the trap to something like clicking on a fake link send through chat by an unknown number we felt how can we make it more secure and help our fellow citizens.

Typing Transfer is model future banking system that approves transactions leveraging the power of TypingDNA.
No need to fill forms and wait in line and submit papers and transfer money. Do it all through your computer/phone with your TypingDNA as a part of secure authentication/verirfication.

  - Transfer money to other accounts - approve transactions using your TypingDNA.
